# Smart_Plug_for_EV_Chargers_with_CEB

## 📘 Project Overview

**Smart Plug for EV Chargers** is a collaborative project with the **Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)** aimed at developing a cloud-connected, intelligent plug system for electric vehicle (EV) charging applications.

The system is designed to support high-current EV charging (up to 30A), provide real-time electrical monitoring, secure user authentication, and seamless cloud integration. It is built in compliance with international standards, ensuring safety, reliability, and compatibility within modern smart grid environments.
